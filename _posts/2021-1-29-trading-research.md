# 2021.1.29 - Trading Research
What a day! What a week! It’s been a thrilling ride and I would have paid double to be able to participate in all of this. 

In fact as a side note I would have but Robinhood blocked my purchase... So I'll definitely be leaving them as soon as this is all over.

Thank you to the amazing people at [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets) for making it all possible.

## Brass Tacks
I’ve spent the last 48 hours glued to my phone and laptop attempting to soak up as much knowledge as I can from every source possible to understand what the short squeeze is and how we can expect the next couple of weeks to go. With particular attention to exit strategies.

So far - and I’m far from done - I’ve come to these key points:
* Hold
* Buy
* Don’t sell
* Also, hold

What follows is just my raw, as-is notes. My hope is to eventually just share out sections of my [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/) graph as is appropriate, but the share feature isn't secure yet. So that'll have to wait.

I'll likely put together another post synthesizing this and what I continue to learn in order to try and explain what a gamma squeeze is, how this particular situation was made possible, and what else we might look for in the future as indicators of another possible short-squeeze. Although I don't see Wall Street making this mistake again.

## Notes

* [what is a stock?](https://learn.robinhood.com/articles/6FKal8yK9kk22uk65x3Jno/what-is-a-stock/)
	* how they work
		* allow companies to raise money for operation
			* _is that only at IPO?_
		* **shares** are bought and sold on an **exchange** like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or Nasdaq
		* in some cases they can be sold privately
			* _why? how? should I care?_
		* regulations on how they can be bought/sold/distributed are made by the SEC
		* can trade either **common stock** or **preferred stock**
		> * **example:**  
			> If a company has 100 shares of stock outstanding, and you own 1 share, you own 1% of that company. The value of your shares will represent approximately that percentage (1%) of the company’s market capitalization, or the value of all outstanding shares.
			* _why do we think it's worth 1% of the market cap? Isn't it only worth the dividends?_
		> * **example:**
			> Imagine that you want to own a cupcake shop, but you only have $1,000 to start. In order to buy the necessary supplies (e.g., flour, icing, cupcake tins), you might raise money from friends and family. Let’s pretend that four of your friends each kick in $1,000, so you have $5,000 total and you’re able to get the business off the ground. In exchange for their investment, you might agree to give each of them 20% of the business and its profits. This is kind of how stocks work, except on a much larger level.
			* _but do you as the cupcake business get anything when people trade your stock? seems like a great way to raise money once._

			* both are **derivatives** * their value is based on another asset e.g. **commodities**, **shares**, currencies, etc.
			* are contracts based on fluctuation of underlying asset
	* **stock**, **bond**s, and other things are traded on the stock market
